This project involves testing five different machine learning models to determine eye states based on inherently noisy EEG data. We use a generalized linear model as a transparent baseline, and a naive bayes model as a simple probabilistic benchmark, which performed the worst overall. Our unsupervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) improved upon the static models by capturing temporal patterns in the signal. Our supervised HMM, which incorporates the eye-state labels into its state transitions, performed even better, achieving the second highest accuracy. Our best results came from a unidirectional LSTM, which effectively handled the temporal dependencies and noise in the EEG data, highlighting the value of sequence-aware models for predicting real world behavior.
